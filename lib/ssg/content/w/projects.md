# Active Projects

* [**bus1**](https://github.com/bus1): A capability-based IPC system for Linux,
  as well as an ecosystem to spread the underlying technologies.

* [**dbus-broker**](https://github.com/bus1/dbus-broker/wiki): The standard
  D-Bus message broker used by most Linux systems.

* [**Linux**](https://kernel.org): Many contributions to, and maintenance of,
  subsystems in the Linux kernel, including new APIs (e.g., `bpf-lpm-trie`,
  `DRM-render-nodes`, `evdev-event-masks`, `EVIOCREVOKE`, `memfd_create(2)`,
  `NETLINK_LIST_MEMBERSHIPS`, `shm-sealing`, `SO_BINDTOIFINDEX`,
  `SO_PEERGROUPS`, `x86/sysfb`), maintenance work in graphics and
  input-handling subsystems (e.g., `Bluetooth`, `DRM`, `HID`) as well as some
  device drivers and driver subsystems (e.g., `BT-HIDP`, `UHID`,
  `HID-wiimote`, `simplefb`).

* [**nettools**](https://nettools.github.io): An independent, stand-alone and
  unopinionated implementation of standard network management protocols. Among
  others, it provides the standard DHCP implementation used by most Linux
  systems.

* [**r-efi**](https://github.com/r-efi/r-efi/wiki): A suite of Rust Packages to
  enable UEFI programming environments for the Rust programming language.

* [**Robius**](https://robius.rs): We contribute to *Project Robius*, a
  collaborative effort to advance the Rust programming language to better suit
  the needs of application developers.

## Past Contributions

Followingly, a short overview of past contributions:

* [**BlueZ**](http://www.bluez.org/): Contributions to the input-device layer
  of the Linux bluetooth stack.

* [**c-util**](https://c-util.github.io): A collection of C utility libraries
  maintained as independent project.

* [**kmscon**](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/kmscon/): A user-space
  console to replace the kernel VT subsystem.

* [**osbuild**](https://osbuild.org): Past maintenance and contributions to
  **Image-Builder**, the backend infrastructure used by
  [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) et al to assemble their operating system
  images.

* **srvx** & **ircu**: Maintenance of a fork of the
  [_ircu_](https://github.com/UndernetIRC/ircu2) and
  [_srvx_](https://github.com/GameSurge/srvx) projects for a German IRC
  network.

* [**systemd**](https://systemd.io): Past maintainance and contributions to the
  core system manager at the heart of most linux distributions.

* [**Wayland**](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/): Early contributions to the
  reference implementation and documentation of the Wayland protocol, as well
  as initial adopters like _wlterm_.

* [**xwiimote**](https://xwiimote.github.io/xwiimote/): Based on the excellent
  reverse engineering documents by the Wii-Homebrew group, *xwiimote* provides
  Linux kernel device drivers for the Nintendo Wii Remote Controller, as well
  as some user-space components to interact with it.
