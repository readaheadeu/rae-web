# Maintenance Makefile
#

#
# Global Setup
#
# This section sets some global parameters that get rid of some old `make`
# annoyences.
#
#     SHELL
#         We standardize on `bash` for better inline scripting capabilities,
#         and we always enable `pipefail`, to make sure individual failures
#         in a pipeline will be treated as failure.
#
#     .SECONDARY:
#         An empty SECONDARY target signals gnu-make to keep every intermediate
#         files around, even on failure. We want intermediates to stay around
#         so we get better caching behavior.
#

SHELL			:= /bin/bash -eo pipefail

.SECONDARY:

#
# Parameters
#
# The set of global parameters that can be controlled by the caller and the
# calling environment.
#
#     BUILDDIR
#         Path to the directory used to store build artifacts. This defaults
#         to `./data`, so all artifacts are stored in a subdirectory that can
#         be easily cleaned.
#
#     SRCDIR
#         Path to the source code directory. This defaults to `.`, so it
#         expects `make` to be called from within the source directory.
#
#     BIN_*
#         For all binaries that are executed as part of this makefile, a
#         variable called `BIN_<exe>` defines the path or name of the
#         executable. By default, they are set to the name of the binary.
#

BUILDDIR		?= ./data
SRCDIR			?= .

BIN_DOCKER		?= docker
BIN_FILE		?= file
BIN_ID			?= id
BIN_MKDIR		?= mkdir
BIN_RM			?= rm
BIN_TEST		?= test
BIN_ZOLA		?= zola

#
# Generic Targets
#
# The following is a set of generic targets used across the makefile. The
# following targets are defined:
#
#     help
#         This target prints all supported targets. It is meant as
#         documentation of targets we support and might use outside of this
#         repository.
#         This is also the default target.
#
#     $(BUILDDIR)/
#     $(BUILDDIR)/%/
#         This target simply creates the specified directory. It is limited to
#         the build-dir as a safety measure. Note that this requires you to use
#         a trailing slash after the directory to not mix it up with regular
#         files. Lastly, you mostly want this as order-only dependency, since
#         timestamps on directories do not affect their content.
#
#     FORCE
#         Dummy target to use as dependency to force `.PHONY` behavior on
#         targets that cannot use `.PHONY`.
#

# Test Statics
#
# This contains availability and content tests for static paths in the

# Basic content-verification is placed here, but elaborate tests belong into
# the generator-based tests for each data type.
